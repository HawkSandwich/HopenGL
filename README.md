# HopenGL
Ambitious game in OpenGL using SDL3

Where I'm at:
- SDL3 with OpenGL Context
- "Old OpenGL" drawing simple triangles

Next up:
- Implement GLEW for modern OpenGL bindings
- Learn about OpenGL in a 2D context
- Implement sound
- Implement inputs via keyboard+mouse, gamepad
- Do some 3D graphics

Far future:
- CoD-zombies like multiplayer game with a voxel level editor and Steam integration.

Blocks and Bones by HawkSandwich (On Steam)

The goal is to make this game, better than before, without using a game engine.
